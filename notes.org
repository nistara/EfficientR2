* Metaprogramming
- Static
- Dynamic - capture things as they're happening

To avoid issues of rm(list = ls())

e = new.env()
cource("BIG.R", e)

- new.env() creates a new environment
- evaluate all commands inside `e` environment, which can look along the R searh path
- it can see into the global env but it won't write into the glob env
- find all the top level variables and remove them
- top level - variable that's constructed
- can have multiple environments in the same session

* Bad functions
- Vectorize()
- ifelse()
- data.frame, while not bad, can take up time as well
